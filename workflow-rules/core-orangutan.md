# core-orangutan (v0.1.0.0.0.0 stub)

This file is a placeholder for future workflow validation rules ("orangutan")
for the multi-CLI agent team.

Guiding ideas for orangutan in v0.1.0.0.0.0:

- Keep agent outputs deterministic, structured, and primarily in markdown.
- Do not change the agreed file structure or agent roles in v0.1.0.0.0.0.
- Prefer incremental improvements over large refactors.
- Make subprocess I/O simple: JSON in on stdin, markdown out on stdout.
- The v0.1.0.0.0.0 orchestrator does **not** enforce these rules programmatically yet.
