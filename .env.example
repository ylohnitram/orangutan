# Example environment configuration for FlowLint / orangutan orchestrator.
#
# Currently, NO environment variables are required for LLM CLI tools:
# - Gemini CLI
# - Claude CLI
# - ChatGPT CLI
# - Q CLI
#
# Each of these tools is expected to be configured by the user via
# its own OAuth login flow (flat tariff) before being used by the
# orchestrator. Tokens and config are stored by the CLIs themselves.
#
# This file is intentionally minimal and can be extended later for
# OPTIONAL tuning flags if needed, for example:
#
#   # export Q_CLI_PROFILE=my-profile
#
# To use it:
#   # copy to .env
#   # add any optional configuration you need
#   # source .env   # before running `make run-pipeline`
